**Problem Statement: Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Comments**

**Problem Statement:**
In the era of widespread social media usage, online platforms have become a double-edged sword. While they provide an avenue for open communication and expression, they also facilitate the propagation of hate speech and offensive content. The rise of hate speech in online comments poses significant challenges for maintaining a respectful and inclusive digital environment.

The objective of this project is to develop a Hate Speech Detection model using a Decision Tree Classifier to automatically identify and flag comments containing hate speech, offensive language, or discriminatory content. The model aims to assist social media platforms, content moderators, and online communities in efficiently filtering out harmful comments and fostering a more positive online discourse.

**Dataset Description:**
To train and evaluate the Hate Speech Detection model, a carefully curated dataset of social media comments will be used. The dataset consists of labeled comments, each tagged as one of the following categories:

1. Hate Speech: Comments containing offensive language, slurs, or discriminatory content aimed at a particular individual or group based on attributes like race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or any other protected characteristic.

2. Non-Hate Speech: Comments that are neutral and do not contain any offensive or discriminatory language.

The dataset will be split into two subsets: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the Decision Tree Classifier, allowing it to learn patterns and features indicative of hate speech. The testing set will be used to evaluate the model's performance and calculate its accuracy.

Along with the comments that are taken from the social media the Dataset also contains several columns like Count,hatespeech,offensive language. Here Count is the number of bad words in the comment, hatespeech column tells us about the whether the comment is hatespeech or not, offensive language is similar to the hatespeech column.

**Model and Performance:**
The Hate Speech Detection model employs a Decision Tree Classifier, a widely-used supervised machine learning algorithm capable of handling both numerical and categorical data. The Decision Tree Classifier creates a tree-like structure by recursively splitting the data based on specific features, leading to decision nodes that represent different classification rules.

After training the model on the labeled training set, the accuracy of the Decision Tree Classifier will be calculated on the testing set. The reported accuracy of 86.62% indicates that the model successfully classifies approximately 86.62% of the social media comments accurately as either hate speech or non-hate speech.

It is important to note that the model's performance may be influenced by factors such as the quality and size of the training dataset, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Continuous evaluation and improvement are essential to enhance the model's ability to combat hate speech effectively.

**Conclusion:**
The Hate Speech Detection model based on the Decision Tree Classifier offers a promising solution to address the growing concern of hate speech in social media comments. By accurately identifying and flagging harmful content, this model can play a vital role in promoting a safer and more respectful digital environment for all users. However, further research and updates to the model should be pursued to ensure its continued effectiveness in combating evolving forms of hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms.
